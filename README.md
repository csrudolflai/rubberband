CRUD UI for Elasticsearch. Goals:

- Good looking
- Make it easy for non-technical folks to audit and clean the data manually
- Clean and no assumptions, so that you can customize this without too much hassle
- Single page app that's easily hosted on S3 or Netlify and can connect to a simple ES api anywhere, including localhost.
